Machine Learning using R-Studio
This analysis aims to classify E.coli genes into two categories in an experiment based on their quantified genotype features. The classification was done using four methods:
principal component analysis (PCA)
linear discriminant analysis (LDA)
Neural network analysis
Random forest algorithm.
